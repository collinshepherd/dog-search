# dog-search

This website allows users to search through sheltered dogs, filter by breed, and add dogs to a favorites list. Once the favorites list is complete, users can generate a match based on the selected dogs. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills to Fetch for a potential hire.

## Features

- **Search and Filter by Breed**: Search for sheltered dogs and filter by breed.
- **Pagination**: Results are paginated for easy browsing.
- **Sorting**: Results are sorted alphabetically by breed by default, and users can modify the sorting to ascending or descending order.
- **Favorite Dogs**: Users can select their favorite dogs from the search results.
- **Generate Match**: After selecting favorite dogs, users can generate and view their best match.
